oh-my-posh has some nice themes, including "official" Catppuccin ones, however I personally do not like those.
They do not fit nicely to the neovim and tmux themes (I am using Frappe).
This one is based on few included ones, to get the look I wanted, with added palette for official Catppuccin
Frappe colors.
